# Key points regarding the app

- this is a single page React/Redux application.
- this is built with the help of create-react-app boilerplate.
- the .json files provided were uploaded to FIREBASE database. 
- the api calls are made using axios.
- the UI state of the app is maintained in react where as the 'score' of the quiz is maintained in Redux
- the app follows a modular CSS approach. 
- the app is responsive in nature.
- for mobile screens the nav links appear in a slider as opposed to in the navigation bar for desktop screens.
